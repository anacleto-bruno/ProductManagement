			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Backend Infrastructure with Docker and PostgreSQL",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the backend infrastructure setup into discrete components: project structure creation, Docker configuration, database setup, Entity Framework initialization, dependency injection configuration, and environment setup.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple technologies (Docker, PostgreSQL, .NET Core, Azure Functions, Entity Framework) and architectural decisions. Clean Architecture setup requires careful planning and multiple configuration steps."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement PostgreSQL Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate database schema design into entity modeling, relationship design, migration creation, index optimization, and documentation generation phases.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving database design principles, Entity Framework migrations, many-to-many relationships, and performance considerations with proper indexing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Database Seeding with Mock Data",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide seeding implementation into mock data generation service, API endpoint creation, parameter validation, and relationship establishment components.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity task requiring data generation libraries, API endpoint implementation, and validation logic, but relatively straightforward compared to infrastructure setup."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core CRUD API Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break CRUD implementation into separate endpoints (Create, Read, Update, Delete), DTO mapping layer, validation implementation, error handling, and API documentation.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple endpoints, validation requirements, proper HTTP status codes, error handling, and Azure Functions specifics with FluentValidation integration."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Product List with Pagination",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate pagination into query parameter handling, pagination logic implementation, metadata calculation, and sorting functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving pagination algorithms, metadata calculations, database optimization with Skip/Take, and sorting implementation."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Dynamic Search and Filtering",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break search functionality into search endpoint implementation, full-text search integration, Redis caching setup, result highlighting, relevance scoring, and pagination integration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple search strategies, Redis caching integration, PostgreSQL full-text search, performance optimization, and result relevance algorithms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Setup React Frontend with Modern Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide frontend setup into project initialization, TypeScript configuration, UI library setup, state management configuration, and environment/routing setup.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple modern React libraries (Vite, shadcn, Zustand, React Query, React Router), TypeScript strict mode, and architectural decisions for state management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Product List UI with Pagination",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break UI implementation into product list component, pagination controls, loading/error states, and responsive design implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving React Query integration, shadcn components, responsive design, state management with Zustand, and proper loading states."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Search UI with Real-time Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate search UI into debounced input component, API integration, search result display, search history implementation, and advanced filters.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to debouncing logic, real-time updates, localStorage integration, advanced filtering, and proper state synchronization with URL parameters."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CRUD Operations UI",

			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide testing into backend unit tests, backend integration tests, frontend component tests, frontend integration tests, test database setup, coverage reporting, and CI/CD integration.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity covering both backend and frontend testing with high coverage targets, TestContainers, multiple testing frameworks, and CI/CD integration requirements."

		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break optimization into database performance tuning, caching implementation, API optimization, comprehensive documentation creation, and monitoring setup.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving performance analysis, caching strategies, documentation writing, and monitoring implementation, but less technical complexity than core development tasks."
